<i>Geometry and Arithmetic of Surfaces</i> is a workshop for early career
researchers (undergraduates, graduate students, post docs, etc.) being
held at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, February 9-10, 2019. This
workshop will focus on providing a diverse group of early career
researchers the opportunity to learn about interesting cutting edge topics in the
arithmetic and algebraic geometry of surfaces from a diverse set of
prominent active researchers: <a href="https://sites.math.washington.edu/~bviray/">Bianca Viray</a>, 
<a href="https://www.math.utah.edu/~honigs/">Katrina Honigs</a>, 
<a href="http://math.rice.edu/~av15/">Anthony V&aacute;rilly-Alvarado</a>, and <a href="http://people.math.sc.edu/kassj/">Jesse Kass</a>.
<br><br>
The goals of this workshop are:
<ul>
<li> Introduce participants to cutting edge research topics, and senior
researchers in the algebraic and arithmetic geometry of surfaces.</li>
<li> Strengthen the network mathematicians from generally underrepresented groups, in particular women and non-binary researchers, in
algebraic and arithmetic geometry, and the surrounding areas.</li>
<li> Develop collaborative relationships that cut across standard
topic-collaborations and involve diverse groups of researchers.</li>
</ul>
Towards these goals the workshop will consist of four mini-courses, five
minute talks given by graduate student participants, and small group discussions.
<br><br>
Each mini-course will consist of two 50-minutes talks.These talks should accessible to a 
wide audience and practice exercises related to the topic will be provided. 
Additionally, during lunch there will be five minute talks that allow
the graduate student participants to introduce themselves and their research. In
doing this we hope to promote a sense of community amongst the
participants, and open the door for collaborative conversations.
Finally, the workshop will also have dedicated time for small group
discussions. These discussions will give the early career researchers a
more informal chance to talk to the speakers, who are experts in the
area.

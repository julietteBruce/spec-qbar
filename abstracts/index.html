	<b>Title:</b> Low degree points on curves
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Abstract:</b> In this talk we will discuss an arithmetic analogue
	of the gonality of a curve over a number field: the smallest
	positive integer e such that the points of residue degree bounded by
	e are infinite. By work of Faltings, Harris--Silverman and
	Abramovich--Harris, it is well-understood when this invariant is 1,
	2, or 3; by work of Debarre--Fahlaoui these criteria do not
	generalize to e at least 4. We will study this invariant using the
	auxiliary geometry of a surface containing the curve and devote
	particular attention to scenarios under which we can guarantee that
	this invariant is actually equal to the gonality . This is joint
	work with Geoffrey Smith.

<b>Title:</b> The Brauer-Manin obstruction and the order of Brauer classes that capture it.
<br>
<br>
<b>Abstracts:</b>The Brauer-Manin obstruction is a powerful and
mysterious compatibility that local points on a variety must satisfy in
order to approximate a global solution.  In the first lecture, we will
explain how quadratic reciprocity and higher reciprocity laws encode
this compatibility via the Brauer group.  We will provide a flavor of
the different types of Brauer classes and the methods we have for
understanding them, particularly in the case of surfaces.  In the second
lecture, we focus on a finer understanding of the Brauer-Manin
obstruction, namely on the order of elements that capture the
obstruction.  We present results, joint with Brendan Creutz,
characterising these orders in the case of torsors under abelian
varieties, Kummer surfaces, and (conditional on the finiteness of
Tate-Shafarevich groups) bielliptic surfaces.

	<b>Title:</b> Derived Torelli theorems in positive characteristic
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Abstract:</b> Broadly speaking, Torelli theorems are concerned
	with the question of when a variety can be recovered from an
	invariant associated to it. The global Torelli theorem, proved in
	the 1970â€™s, shows that K3 and Enriques surfaces over $\mathbb{C}$
	are determined by cohomological data. There is no known equivalent
	statement that holds generally over algebraically closed fields of
	positive characteristic. Progress in this direction has been made
	recently: statements giving Torelli-type theorems in terms of
	derived categories have been proven. In the first of these talks, I
	will introduce the notion of lifting from positive characteristic to
	characteristic 0, which plays a central role in the proofs of these
	theorems.

	<b>Title:</b> Intimations of descent on K3 surfaces
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Abstract:</b> The method of descent gives a way to determine,
	under favorable circumstances, the group of rational points on an
	elliptic curve.  The starting point for the method is an isogeny of
	elliptic curves.  For K3 surfaces, a suitable replacement for an
	isogeny is a rational isomorphism of Hodge structures.  These "K3
	isogenies" can be reinterpreted in terms of the Brauer group of a K3
	surface. In the first lecture, I will review the classification of
	algebraic surfaces, and go over material on del Pezzo surfaces and
	K3 surfaces (and their Brauer groups), in preparation for the second
	lecture.  In the second lecture, I will report on recent work with
	Jen Berg, which shows how in some cases one can perform a
	"3-descent" on a K3 surface to prove that it has no rational points.

	<b>Title:</b> Counting curves over an arithmetically interesting field
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Abstract:</b> Given two general degree \(d\) complex polynomials
	\(f(x,y)\) and \(g(x,y)\), the equation \(f(x,y) + t g(x,y)\) defines a
	singular curve for exactly \(3(d-1)^2\) complex values of \(t\). This is a
	classical result that has been generalized in many ways to results
	counting complex curves, but the problem of generalizing it by
	replacing the complex numbers with a more arithmetically interesting
	field, such as the rational numbers or a finite field or..., has
	only been taken up recently.  I will describe this recent work,
	especially work of the speaker, Marc Levine, and Kirsten Wickelgren,
	in my talk.
